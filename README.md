## Primer: A conversation with ChatGPT 3.5 about SQL challenges

It's interesting to see how well ChatGPT works and where its (current) limitations are, so I chatted with it about some of our SQL challenges. I found it a [fun read](00_primer_chatgpt_on_sql/ChatGPT_SQLChallenges5.md)!

## Primer: No-Hangman

At the end of the two-weeks primer course on SQL, Tableau and Python, everybody builds a simple text-based Hangman (click on the image for my take on it):

## Chapter 1: Eniac expansion from Spain to Brazil

In this [case study](01_eniac_magist_case_study), the company Eniac wants to expand
its business to Brazil and evaluates the potential after-sales fulfillment partner
Magist for its suitability.

## Chapter 2: Introduction to pandas

As second basic data-handling system after SQL, we were introduced to the Python
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library.
Read about our challenges [here](02_pandas)!

## Chapter 5: Data Pipelines on the Cloud

In [this](05_cloud_pipelines) two-week project, we learned and exercised ETL data-engineering skills, i.e. extracting, transforming and loading data into storage for comprehensive analysis. We scraped the web, used public APIs, transformed and augmented the data and stored it in an SQL database. The finished ETL process was then wrapped into a Google cloud function for automatic execution and I even went further to produce automatically updated reports on the data.

One of the deliverables was a blog post which I wrote on [dev.to](https://dev.to/tvogel/from-scraping-in-the-cloud-to-streams-of-insights-oe9).
