# Primer: No-Hangman

At the end of the two-weeks primer course on SQL, Tableau and Python, everybody builds a simple text-based Hangman game hosted on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). I did a variation which  features:

- IPyWidgets based UI
- Import of a Hangman word-bank from github
- Import and manipulation of an SVG clip-art graphics file to visualize game progress
- Scoring of word-difficulty by letter-frequency in English
- Random choice of word to guess by three levels of difficulty
- Multiple rounds
- Funky colored petals as a reward for winners

Have a look and click, then choose [Runtime] &rarr; [Run all] to play:
