# Primer: An interesting conversation with ChatGPT 3.5

I have not played with ChatGPT a lot, yet, so I was interested to see how it would deal with the kind of SQL challenges that we were working on in the Data Science Bootcamp primer. The conversation was in fact _quite_ interesting. I was impressed by the quality of insight into the provided data and by the useful suggestions how to solve them. But also surprised, seeing it's limitations and dead-ends when trying to help it get back on track when it somehow got lost.

Have fun [reading](ChatGPT_SQLChallenges5.md)!

I'd be curious to see how ChatGPT 4.0 would deal.
