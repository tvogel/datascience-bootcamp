# Chapter 2: Introduction to pandas

The topics of our second bootcamp week for learning
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) were:

- data import
- filtering
- aggregation
- string filtering including regexps
- range and set filtering
- grouping
- joins/merges
- plotting

and two more general topics:

- functions
- error handling and debugging techniques

For this, we were primarily using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)/[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/). I collected my Colab Jupyter notebooks [here](docs).

The most fun ones were:

- [advanced transformations](docs/10-advanced-transformations__sql-to-pd.ipynb)
- [plotting](docs/12-pandas-plot.ipynb)
- [functions](docs/13-functions.ipynb) including a graph of statistics of coin-tossing
- cleaning and analyzing a database of [metal bands](docs/15-bonus-data-cleaning-metal-bands.ipynb)
- [debugging](docs/16-debugging-challenges.ipynb)
