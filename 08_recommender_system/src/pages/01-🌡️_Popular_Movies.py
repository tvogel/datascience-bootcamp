- Introducing Our Popularity Recommender
- We utilized the widely recognized weighted average rating formula from IMDb

The score is calculated as

$$
W = \\frac{v\cdot R + m\cdot C}{v + m}
$$

where

- R is the average rating of the movie
- C is the mean rating across all movies
- v is the number of votes for the movie
- m is the minimum votes required to be listed,\\
  in our case: the 90th percentile of the number of votes.
