- This function retrieves recommendations based on _item similarity_.
- It calculates the scoring using _cosine_ similarity of user ratings between the reference item and all other items.
- The scores are attenuated by a _sigmoid_ function to underweight scores that are based on less than 10 common raters.
- The scores are _pre-computed_ and read from a pickle file.
